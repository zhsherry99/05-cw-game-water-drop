# charity: water – Water Drop Game Starter
In this game, users collect as many falling water drops as possible. Users tap to collect drops before they hit the ground. You’ll be working from a partially built version of the game. Some functionality is already provided, and your job is to complete the rest.

## What’s Already Done

The starter files already include:

- A **heading and tagline**
- A **start button**
- A **game container** where water drops appear
- A **placeholder timer and score** (not functional yet)
- A **logo image** from charity: water
- Working code that:
  - Starts the game when the start button is clicked
  - Makes water drops fall randomly
  - Makes drops disappear when clicked


## What You Need to Add

Here’s what you're required to implement to bring the game to life:

### Game Functionality

- **Update the score**
  - +1 point for each drop clicked  

- **Add a 30-second timer**
  - When the timer reaches 0, the game ends  

- **Display a message when the game ends**
  - If the player scores **20 or more points**, show a **winning** message  
  - If the player scores **less than 20 points**, show a **"try again"** message  
  - Create one array of possible winning messages and one array of losing messages
  - Depending on whether the user wins or loses, randomly pick and display a message from the appropriate array

### Visual Styling

- Add **charity: water branding**
  - Use the provided logo  
  - Use the [charity: water brand guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ct4zYRIwHAtxoNQoeaVwWYPdnruSC6sr/view) to stay on-brand with colors and styling


These are the minimum requirements, but if you'd like an additional challenge go ahead and give the LevelUps a shot! For example, you can set up logic to make some of the drops "bad" drops that remove points if the user click them, complete with a different color to distinguish them from "good" drops. Have fun and make the game your own!
